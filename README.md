# Algorithms to get GCD

## Concept

This is just a practice for discrete mathematics to prove differents algorothim to
get the Greatest Common Divisor using Euclides' Algorith and Factorial Descomposition
in python.

## How to run these codes?

### Run the code

```bash
python euclides.py <number-1> <number-2>
python descompistion.py <number-1> <number-2>
```

### Run the test?

```bash
python -m unittest test_*.py

# OR if you pytest installed

pytest .
```
